SmartHDD GUI
Created by: 

Our software program SmartHDD GUI was created using Visual Studio and c++. The program retrieves SMART values 197, 197, 198 for HDD only. If it cannot retrieve all 3, the entry will not be saved in the database.
TeraDrive requested this software tool in order to gain insight on customer HDDs before providing extended warranty.
