Max Attributes=29

[Attrib0]
Id=1
Critical=1
Name=Raw Read Error Rate
Details=This attribute value depends of read errors, disk surface condition and indicates the rate of hardware read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface. Lower values indicate that there is a problem with either disk surface or read/write heads


[Attrib1]
Id=2
Critical=0
Name=Throughput Performance
Details=Overall (general) throughput performance of a hard disk drive. If the value of this attribute is deceasing there is a high probability of troubles with your disk.


[Attrib2]
Id=3
Critical=0
Name=Spin Up Time
Details=Average time of spindle spin up (from zero RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) to fully operational). Active SMART shows the raw value of this attribute in milliseconds or seconds.


[Attrib3]
Id=4
Critical=0
Name=Start/Stop Count
Details=This raw value of this attribute is a count of hard disk spindle start/stop cycles


[Attrib4]
Id=5
Critical=1
Name=Reallocated Sectors Count
Details=Count of reallocated sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks this sector as "reallocated" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area).
This process is also known as remapping and "reallocated" sectors are called remaps. This is why, on a modern hard disks, you can not see "bad blocks" while testing the surface - all bad blocks are hidden in reallocated sectors. However, the more sectors that are reallocated, the more a sudden decrease (up to 10% and more) can be noticed in the disk read/write speed.


[Attrib5]
Id=6
Critical=0
Name=Read Channel Margin
Details=Margin of a channel while reading data. The function of this attribute is not specified.


[Attrib6]
Id=7
Critical=0
Name=Seek Error Rate
Details=Rate of seek errors of the magnetic heads. If there is a failure in the mechanical positioning system, a servo damage or a thermal widening of the hard disk, seek errors arise. More seek errors indicates a worsening condition of a disk surface and the disk mechanical subsystem.


[Attrib7]
Id=8
Critical=0
Name=Seek Time Performance
Details=Average performance of seek operations of the magnetic heads. If this attribute is decreasing, it is a sign of problems in the hard disk drive mechanical subsystem.


[Attrib8]
Id=9
Critical=0
Name=Power-On Hours
Details=Count of hours in power-on state. The raw value of this attribute shows total count of hours (or minutes, or seconds, depending on manufacturer) in power-on state. A decrease of this attribute value to the critical level (threshold) indicates a decrease of the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures).
However, in reality, even if the MTBF value falls to zero, it does not mean that the MTBF resource is completely exhausted and the drive will not function normally.


[Attrib9]
Id=10
Critical=0
Name=Spin Retry Count
Details=Count of retry of spin start attempts. This attribute stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational speed (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). A decrease of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.


[Attrib10]
Id=11
Critical=0
Name=Recalibration Retries
Details=This attribute indicates the number of times recalibration was requested (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). A decrease of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.


[Attrib11]
Id=12
Critical=0
Name=Device Power Cycle Count
Details=This attribute indicates the count of full hard disk power on/off cycles.

[Attrib12]
Id=13
Critical=0
Name=Soft Read Error Rate
Details=This is the rate of "program" read errors occurring when reading data from a disk surface.


[Attrib13]
Id=221
Critical=0
Name=G-Sense Error Rate
Details=Rate of errors occurring as a result of impact loads. This attribute stores an indication of a shock-sensitive sensor, that is, the total quantity of errors occurring as a result of internal impact loads (dropping drive, wrong installation, etc.).


[Attrib14]
Id=228
Critical=0
Name=Power-Off Retract Count
Details=This attribute shows a count of the number of times the drive was powered down.


[Attrib15]
Id=193
Critical=0
Name=Load/Unload Cycle Count
Details=Count of load/unload cycles into Landing Zone position. For more info see the Head Load/Unload Technology description.


[Attrib16]
Id=194
Critical=0
Name=Temperature
Details=Hard disk drive temperature. The raw value of this attribute shows built-in heat sensor registrations (in degrees centigrade). 


[Attrib17]
Id=196
Critical=1
Name=Reallocation Event Count
Details=Count of remap operations (transfering data from a bad sector to a special reserved disk area - spare area).
The raw value of this attribute shows the total number of attempts to transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area. Unsuccessful attempts are counted as well as successful.


[Attrib18]
Id=197
Critical=1
Name=Current Pending Sector Count
Details=Current count of unstable sectors (waiting for remapping). The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of sectors waiting for remapping. Later, when some of these sectors are read successfully, the value is decreased. If errors still occur when reading some sector, the hard drive will try to restore the data, transfer it to the reserved disk area (spare area) and mark this sector as remapped. If this attribute value remains at zero, it indicates that the quality of the corresponding surface area is low.


[Attrib19]
Id=198
Critical=1
Name=Uncorrectable Sector Count
Details=Quantity of uncorrectable errors. The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates that there are evident defects of the disk surface and/or there are problems in the hard disk drive mechanical subsystem.


[Attrib20]
Id=199
Critical=0
Name=UltraDMA CRC Error Count
Details=The total quantity of CRC errors during UltraDMA mode. The raw value of this attribute indicates the number of errors found during data transfer in UltraDMA mode by ICRC (Interface CRC).


[Attrib21]
Id=200
Critical=0
Name=Write Error Rate (Multi Zone Error Rate)
Details=Write data errors rate. This attribute indicates the total number of errors found when writing a sector. The higher the raw value, the worse the disk surface condition and/or mechanical subsystem is.


[Attrib22]
Id=220
Critical=1
Name=Disk Shift
Details=Shift of disks towards spindle. The raw value of this attribute indicates how much the disk has shifted. Unit measure is unknown. For more info see G-Force Protection technology description (click to learn more on Seagate website ).
NOTE: Shift of disks is possible as a result of a strong shock or a fall, or for other reasons.


[Attrib23]
Id=222
Critical=0
Name=Loaded Hours
Details=Loading on magnetic heads actuator caused by the general operating time. Only time when the actuator was in the operating position is counted.


[Attrib24]
Id=223
Critical=0
Name=Load/Unload Retry Count
Details=Loading on magnetic heads actuator caused by numerous recurrences of operations like: reading, recording, positioning of heads, etc. Only the time when heads were in the operating position is counted.


[Attrib25]
Id=224
Critical=0

Details=Loading on magnetic heads actuator caused by friction in mechanical parts of the store. Only the time when heads were in the operating position is counted.


[Attrib26]
Id=226
Critical=0
Name=Load-in Time
Details=Total time of loading on the magnetic heads actuator. This attribute indicates total time in which the drive was under load (on the assumption that the magnetic heads were in operating mode and out of the parking area).


[Attrib27]
Id=227
Critical=0
Name=Torque Amplification Count
Details=Count of efforts of the rotating moment of a drive.
